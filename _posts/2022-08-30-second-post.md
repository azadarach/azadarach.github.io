# Fonts

For this post I'm going to talk about fonts.

I found some really fun fonts on [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/) and I thought it would be fun to incorporate some of them in my p5 sketch. Fonts are really important as they help set the tone and the formality of a poster/banner. I think I should stick with the RMIT font for the actual word RMIT but with creative coding I think I have a little bit more room to have some fun. It could even be cool to have 'RMIT' randomly popping up on different spots on the page? It will be cool to see what I can do with all the fonts I have available, which I think is unlimited! 

It's pretty easy to use a lot of fonts in my design as all I need to so is download the font files, upload them to p5, reference them in the preload section (I think) and then use them! I'll see what I can do!
