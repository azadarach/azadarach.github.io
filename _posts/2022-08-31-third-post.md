# Here's how my assignment is going!

I took some screenshots of my process but I honestly have absolutely no clue how to put them in here. Do I create a img folder and reference them? I really don't know, markdown confuses bme because it's so simple and complex at the same time. It's a lot more user friendly than I was expecting though, which is always cool. 

I'll just describe my process. I've been toying with a few ideas on what to do for my assignment, it's difficult to pick one. At the start I was definitely thinking something with glitches or something cool like that, maybe with RMIT and Creative Coding Specialisation flashing up in random spots, but I definitely think I'm going to work out how to do that properly and maybe do something cool like that for my next assignment. I think for this assignment, since I'm not feeling 100%, I should really be going for something more simple that is easy and that I can complete without stessing out too much. I'll see how I go! At least I created the file for [my assignment](https://editor.p5js.org/azadarach/sketches/7MoFEudIO).

I want to put in some sound, and I know how thanks to [the p5 reference page on the subject](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.MediaElement/stop) but I'm not quite sure that I'll have the time. We'll see!
